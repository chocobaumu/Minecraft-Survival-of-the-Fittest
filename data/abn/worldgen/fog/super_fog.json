Hello,

This document contains names and other information hidden to prevent plagiarism.
If you've come across this, it means you’re either a developer or a plagiarist.

We’re working hard to create a game that people can enjoy, but claiming it as your own is unacceptable.
Game development requires certain courtesies, and those who lack them are not permitted to use this work or distribute it as a template.

At the very least, if this message remains intact, it will identify the original creator. If someone other than the actual creator claims authorship, I would feel deeply saddened, and I would appreciate it if you could reach out to me.

This work was created for Sotf. It will guide you to a beautiful aquatic paradise.
Now, I wish you sweet dreams.
